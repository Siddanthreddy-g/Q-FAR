# Q-FAR: clustering-based retrieval for RAG

Author: G. Siddanth Reddy

Q-FAR looks at a simple question: if a document collection is split into clusters and each query searches only the
nearest few clusters, how much retrieval quality is lost compared with searching everything, and how does that compare
with standard approximate-search indexes (FAISS IVF and HNSW)?

All clustering code (K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, and SA-AQEE-FCM) is written from scratch in NumPy. Documents and queries
are embedded with `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`.

## Methods compared
| Name in the report | What it is |
|---|---|
| K-Means (previous method) | Hard clustering, `kmean_retrival.py` |
| Fuzzy C-Means (previous method) | Soft clustering with a fixed fuzzifier m, `fuzzycmeans_scratch.py` |
| SA-AQEE-FCM (ours) | Quantum-inspired evolutionary search with self-adaptive rotation and an adaptive fuzzifier, `sa_aqee_fcm.py` |
| FAISS IVF, HNSW | Standard indexes, `their_ann_methods_on_our_data.py` |
| Contriever, DPR, bge-small | Embedding models, `cross_test_their_models.py` |
| Murali and Damodaram (2015) | Our reimplementation of their clustering method, `pfcm_murali_baseline.py` |

## Datasets
BEIR NQ (a 200,000-document subset, 3,452 queries), SciFact, NFCorpus, and SIFT1M (first 200,000 vectors). Datasets and
embedding caches are not in this repository.

## Results
* At the same number of documents searched, SA-AQEE-FCM is close to K-Means on the text datasets (a little below it on
  NQ and NFCorpus, no consistent difference on SciFact) and worse on SIFT1M. It does not beat K-Means or HNSW.
* Adaptive and learned routing improved both clusterings a little and did not change their ranking.

The raw numbers are in `cache_cross/` (JSON).

## Running the experiments
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sa_aqee_fcm.py --dataset nfcorpus --seeds 42 43 44
python sa_aqee_fcm.py --dataset nq --subsample 200000 --emb_dir cache --variants V5 --k 64 --m_min 1.02 --fit_sample 30000 --n_search 1 2 4 8 16 25
python sa_aqee_routing.py --dataset scifact --seeds 42 43 44
python sa_aqee_learned_routing.py --dataset scifact --seeds 42 43 44 --oracle
python our_model_on_sift1m.py --sa_aqee
```
The scripts expect the BEIR datasets and cached embeddings in the folders they create on first use.

## Layout
```
*.py          experiment code (clustering, retrieval, cross-tests, routing)
cache_cross/  saved result files (JSON)
```
Embedding caches, datasets and the virtual environment are not tracked.
